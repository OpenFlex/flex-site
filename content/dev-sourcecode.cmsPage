Title:  Source Code

We use [Git][1] for version control. You can [browse our repository][2] in your web browser. The development of the Flex SDK is done on branches and merged on 'develop' branch, while release candidates are done on the 'release' branch and merged to the 'master' for the production releases, see [A successful Git branching model][9] for more details.

For further information see the [Git Tutorials & Training][3] page.  Committers need to [properly configure][7] their git client and know the [Suggested Practices][8].

We use [FlexUnit][4] for unit testing. FlexUnit is in the initial phases of being donated to the Apache Flex project, more information will be posted here as it becomes available.

We use [Mockolate][5] for mocks and test spies in unit tests. Read more about Mockolate on the project [homepage][5].

We use Mustella for functional testing of the SDK. You can find more information on the [Wiki page][6].
