Title:  Source Code

We use [Apache Subversion][1] for version control. You can [browse our repository][2] in your web browser. The development of the Flex SDK is done on 'branches/develop', while releases are cut from the 'trunk'.

For further information see the [Apache Source Code Repository][3] page.  Committers need to [properly configure][7] their svn client.
