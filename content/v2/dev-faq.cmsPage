Title:  Frequency Asked Questions

This page covers some frequently asked questions that we get on the mailing lists.  We will be updating it with more
content as time goes on.

<div class="headline"><h4>Can I have write access to the SVN?</h4></div>
Due to leagal reasons, only a select group of people have access to update or contibute code directly to the project.
We at Apache take the legality of code seriously, and nothing would be worse than somebody contibuting code that
they don't own and a 3rd party having a legal claim to our framework.  That being said, you can submit code by providing
`.patch` files (diff files) to the project.  Check out the [Get Involved][1] page for more details on how to do that.

<div class="headline"><h4>How is this different than Adobe Flex?</h4></div>
In November, 2011, Adobe announced they were no longer supporting Adobe Flex.  Instead of just killing the framework they
donated it to Apache.  Apache Flex 4.8.0 is essentially the exact same version of Flex as Adobe's last official
version.  Since that inital donation the Apache Flex team has been working hard on fixing bugs, providing additional
components and finishing unfinished components.  As we progress through additional versions, we will be less and
less like Adobe's Flex framework, but we will strive to be compatible with it.

Adobe has offered some of their customers extended support contracts, and may produce additional versions, but
that is unlikely.  Future support of the Flex Framework is through this project.

There are a few differences you should be aware of in the Apache version of the SDK.  Most notibly, the Flash Player will
not cache RSLs created with Apache Flex.  You can find out more in the RELEASE_NOTES file in your SDK download

<div class="headline"><h4>I've used Adobe Flex before.  How do I start using Apache Flex?</h4></div>
The quickest way to start using Apache Flex is to use the Apache Flex SDK Installer.  This AIR application will download
the latest version of the Apache Flex SDK and all the required components to make it work.  It will also set the proper
options so that the SDK can be used with your favorite IDE such as Flash Builder, FDT, Flash Devlop or IntelliJ.
To use the SDK Installer, go to the ["Download the SDK Installer"][4] link under the downloads menu above.  It will
walk you through the rest of the process.

Once you have the SDK on your computer, it should be just like the old Adobe SDK you were already using.  Make sure
to check the RELEASE_NOTES file for a full list of differences.

<div class="headline"><h4>Why are you not using GIT/GitHub?</h4></div>
The Apache Flex PMC voted on a resolution to move the project to Git once the Apache Infastrcture supported the move.
There is no timeline on that move at this time.  A mirror of the project is currently available on GitHub, but we are
not accepting pull requests at this time.

<div class="headline"><h4>I don't have time to read the mailing lists.  How can I keep up with the project?</h4></div>
The [Open Spoon Foundation][2] has been providing monthly updates as to the goings-on of the Apache Flex project through
their "Apache Revue" newsletter.  You can also check out the [Apache Flex Blog][3] for critical updates.
