## Flex Users Mailing List

This is where community users can get together and discuss flex. This list is **not** 
intended for discussions that should take place on flex-dev. All discussions on this 
list are unofficial discussions. Use this list to get help from fellow flex devlopers, 
to discuss how you use flex, etc...

**Note:** This list does not replace current sources for community support on Adobe 
Flex. Please continue to use those sources for prior version of Flex. This list is 
strictly for future version of Apache Flex.
