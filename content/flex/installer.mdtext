The Apache Flex Installer is an application that simplifies the download and installation of the Apache Flex SDK and its (required) components. It is aimed at anyone who wants to use the latest release of the Apache Flex SDK, but who might not necessarily be familiar with the tools and procedures required to compile the Apache Flex SDK from source code. The application will grab the official, current release of the SDK from [apache.org](http://http://incubator.apache.org/flex/download.html), install it onto your computer and prepare it for use with Adobe Flash Builder. Use the badge below to download the Apache Flex Installer.

Alternatively, you can download the source and/or binaries for the Apache Flex Installer directly:

Note: the installer downloads other files besides the Apache Flex SDK. These files are needed for the proper functioning of the SDK. The required TLF and the OSMF frameworks, as well as the optional Embedded Font Libraries and Utilities and BlazeDS are mentioned separately in the installer application. The other non-Apache files downloaded by the installer are:
<ul>
<li>[Adobe AIR SDK][6]</li>
<li>[GlobalPlayer.swc][7]</li>
<li>[SWFObject.js][8]</li>
</ul>
